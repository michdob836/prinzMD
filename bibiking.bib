abstract = "Electricity generated from renewable sources, which has shown remarkable growth worldwide, can rarely provide immediate response to demand as these sources do not deliver a regular supply easily adjustable to consumption needs. Thus, the growth of this decentralized production means greater network load stability problems and requires energy storage, generally using lead batteries, as a potential solution. However, lead batteries cannot withstand high cycling rates, nor can they store large amounts of energy in a small volume. That is why other types of storage technologies are being developed and implemented. This has led to the emergence of storage as a crucial element in the management of energy from renewable sources, allowing energy to be released into the grid during peak hours when it is more valuable. The work described in this paper highlights the need to store energy in order to strengthen power networks and maintain load levels. There are various types of storage methods, some of which are already in use, while others are still in development. We have taken a look at the main characteristics of the different electricity storage techniques and their field of application (permanent or portable, long- or short-term storage, maximum power required, etc.). These characteristics will serve to make comparisons in order to determine the most appropriate technique for each type of application."

abstract = "In the recent years, lithium-ion batteries have become the battery technology of choice for portable devices, electric vehicles and grid storage. While increasing numbers of car manufacturers are introducing electrified models into their offering, range anxiety and the length of time required to recharge the batteries are still a common concern. The high currents needed to accelerate the charging process have been known to reduce energy efficiency and cause accelerated capacity and power fade. Fast charging is a multiscale problem, therefore insights from atomic to system level are required to understand and improve fast charging performance. The present paper reviews the literature on the physical phenomena that limit battery charging speeds, the degradation mechanisms that commonly result from charging at high currents, and the approaches that have been proposed to address these issues. Special attention is paid to low temperature charging. Alternative fast charging protocols are presented and critically assessed. Safety implications are explored, including the potential influence of fast charging on thermal runaway characteristics. Finally, knowledge gaps are identified and recommendations are made for the direction of future research. The need to develop reliable onboard methods to detect lithium plating and mechanical degradation is highlighted. Robust model-based charging optimisation strategies are identified as key to enabling fast charging in all conditions. Thermal management strategies to both cool batteries during charging and preheat them in cold weather are acknowledged as critical, with a particular focus on techniques capable of achieving high speeds and good temperature homogeneities."

abstract = "In this work, we present a novel approach to identify aging-minimal fast charging profiles for commercial lithium-ion cells by a design of experiment (DOE) methodology and a mechanistic degradation analysis of the obtained capacity retention figures. The DOE is based on the competitive comparison of specific current profiles under repeated application to the tested cell format. The current profiles are obtained from the linear superposition of a constant current profile and four independent, charge-neutral profiles modulating the shape of the base profile. The charge-neutral profiles rely on physically meaningful assumptions about their beneficial effects for the charging procedure, e.g. that a superimposed alternating current (AC) profile reduces unwanted polarization by its intrinsic heat generation. The aging minimal profiles are identified by multiple regression analysis. Mechanistic degradation analysis is applied to study the root cause of the observed capacity roll-over of the cells after a specific cycle number. This roll-over is attributed to the occurrence of lithium plating which itself is driven by active material losses in the initial stages of the cycle life. The onset of the roll-over can be considerably delayed by a suitable choice of the current trajectory, resulting in a more than doubled life expectancy."
